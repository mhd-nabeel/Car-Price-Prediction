Any mistakes or areas for improvement

Give me a sec to go through it...

Thanks for your patience! Here's a quick review of your Colab notebook steps based on the first few cells:

 What You're Doing Well:
Imports are on point:

You’re using pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn for data handling and viz.

You have train_test_split, LabelEncoder, StandardScaler, RandomForestRegressor, and proper metrics for modeling. 

Data Loading:

You load the dataset correctly using pd.read_csv("/content/car_prices.csv").

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

You're checking .head(), .info(), .describe() and value counts—great start for understanding the data.

Checking for duplicates using VINs: 

That’s a smart step—helps in removing repeated entries.

 Suggestions / Next Checks:
I’ll need to look at more cells to see:

Are missing values being handled?

Are categorical variables being encoded correctly?

Is the target variable (price) being separated and used in training?

Are you evaluating and saving the model?
